# ToDoList

ToDoList is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete their todo lists. It is built using the Spring Boot framework.

## Features

- Create Todo Lists: Users can create new todo lists and give them a title.
- View Todo Lists: Users can view all their todo lists on the home page.
- Update Todo Lists: Users can update the title of their existing todo lists.
- Delete Todo Lists: Users can delete their todo lists.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL

## Future Work

- Implement User Registration and Authentication: Enhance the application to include user registration and authentication functionality. This will allow users to create an account, log in securely, and manage their own todo lists.
- Secure Todo List Operations: Once user registration and authentication are implemented, ensure that only authenticated users can perform operations such as creating, updating, and deleting their todo lists.
- User-specific Todo Lists: Associate todo lists with specific users, so each user can only view and manage their own lists.
- Password Encryption: Implement password encryption to securely store user passwords in the database.
- Forgot Password Functionality: Implement a password recovery mechanism for users who forget their passwords.
- User Profile Management: Allow users to update their profile information and manage their account settings.
